# Plan

This project has two main goals at the moment. First is to implement a very light-weight set of interfaces for writing simple games in C, that can also be built and deployed using Emscripten. Second is to show that this can be applied to a more esoteric platform, such as the Nintendo 64.

Some interesting platform-related issues include supporting both fixed and variable timesteps, as well as radically different graphics and audio architectures. Handling different kinds of input is also a challenge.

Much of the inspiration for this project comes from the (massively) cross-platform Retro City Rampage.
